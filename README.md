# Code-Repository
This is my code repository, I have compiled some of the work I did recreationally to present for application processes. Unfortunately, most of the formal projects I worked with have sensitive data that can not be shared. 

## Student-Lotery (Stata)
The folder named Student Lottery has two fabricated datasets (student lottery and voluntary exam). The setting is the following: a school is accepting students for 8th and 9th grade through two random lotteries. Students who won the first lottery automatically enroll in 8th and 9th grades in the particular school, while students that won the second lottery enroll only in 9th grade. Participation in the first lottery does not imply on participation in the second lottery. All students can take a voluntary exam at the end of 8th grade.

## Quinto Andar (R)
Quinto andar is a online housing marketplace in Brazil. In the code, I extract all rent postings for the city of SÃ£o Paulo, gathering all relevant information for each posting (# of bathrooms, # of rooms, floor number, etc). I don't know what I am going to do with the scraped data yet, but I have a few ideas we can chat about :) 

## WFH (R)
The final folder in the repository has the code for my undergraduate project. On it, I download a state-level representative household survey (PNAD) from 2012 through 2024, and its special edition collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (PNAD-COVID19). From PNAD-COVID19, I gather the share of remote work for each sector, and merge with the regular survey in order to estimate WFH effects throughout the years (considering that WFH was zero pre pandemic).
